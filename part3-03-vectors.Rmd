# Vectors

Vectors (similar to single-type arrays in other languages) are ordered collections of simple types, usually numerics, integers, characters, or logicals. We can create vectors using the `c()` function (for concatenate), which takes as parameters the elements to put into the vector:

<pre id=part3-03-concat
     class="language-r 
            line-numbers 
            linkable-line-numbers">
<code>
samples <- c(3.2, 4.7, -3.5)      # 3-element numeric vector
</code></pre>

The `c()` function can take other vectors as parameters, too--it will “deconstruct” all subvectors and return one large vector, rather than a vector of vectors.

<pre id=part3-03-c-deconstruct
     class="language-r 
            line-numbers 
            linkable-line-numbers">
<code>
samples2 <- c(20.4, 4.7, 37.6)      # 5-element numeric vector
print(samples2)                     # prints [1] 20.4, 3.2, 4.7, -3.5, 37.6
</code></pre>
